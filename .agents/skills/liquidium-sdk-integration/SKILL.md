# Liquidium SDK Integration

`@liquidium/client` reads Liquidium market and position data, then executes authless instant loans and advanced profile-based lending flows.

Priority: authless instant loans are the default product flow. Use `client.instantLoans` first, deposit-address profile flows second, and ETH contract interaction only when explicitly needed.

## Default Decision

When the user asks for a simple borrow, loan, collateral deposit, repayment target, or Liquidium integration and does not explicitly ask to manage Liquidium profiles, implement the authless instant-loan flow with `client.instantLoans`.

Do not require the user to create a Liquidium profile, sign a borrow message, or call `client.lending.borrow(...)` for the default flow. The SDK creates the backing lending profile and returns generated deposit and repayment targets.

Use profile-based `client.accounts` and `client.lending` only when the user explicitly asks for advanced profile management, existing profile positions, manual supply/repay tracking, signed borrow/withdraw flows, or lower-level wallet orchestration.

## Modules

```ts
import { LiquidiumClient } from "@liquidium/client";

const client = new LiquidiumClient({});
```

The client exposes: `instantLoans`, `accounts`, `lending`, `positions`, `market`, `activities`, `history`, `quote`.

## Setup

Minimal config:

```ts
const client = new LiquidiumClient({});
```

Richer config when the flow requires it:

```ts
const client = new LiquidiumClient({
  environment: "mainnet",
  apiBaseUrl: "https://your-app.example.com/api/sdk",
  evmRpcUrl: "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<key>",
  timeoutMs: 30_000,
});
```

**Config requirements:**

- `environment`: sets the canister preset. Only `mainnet` is bundled; pass `canisterIds` explicitly for custom deployments
- `apiBaseUrl`: overrides the default Liquidium service root for history, activities, inflow reporting, `instantLoans.create(...)`, and `instantLoans.findByAddress(...)`. It is not needed for `instantLoans.get(...)`, `borrow(...)`, `withdraw(...)`, or default ETH stablecoin deposit-address supply/repay targets
- `evmRpcUrl` / `evmPublicClient`: required for lower-level ETH contract-interaction supply planning and allowance polling. Use `evmRpcHeaders` when the RPC provider authenticates with HTTP headers
- `identity` / `icHost`: custom ICP agent configuration
- `canisterIds.instantLoans`: defaults to mainnet `qdt2k-xqaaa-aaaae-qkapq-cai`; override it for custom deployments

Missing required service configuration is a client configuration problem.
Affected methods throw `LiquidiumErrorCode.VALIDATION_ERROR`, not
`SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`.

For Vite example apps, expose the RPC URL through a `VITE_` variable. If using
Infura, prefer `VITE_INFURA_API_KEY` and derive the URL in app config:

```ts
const evmRpcUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_INFURA_API_KEY
  ? `https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/${import.meta.env.VITE_INFURA_API_KEY}`
  : import.meta.env.VITE_EVM_RPC_URL;
```

Vite env vars are bundled client-side. Treat Infura browser keys as publishable
or route RPC calls through a server if the key must remain private.

## Module Guide

### instantLoans

Authless instant loans. This is the default simple borrow UX: create a loan,
show the generated collateral deposit address, restore by reference, and show
the actionable repayment amount when the user wants to close the loan.

```ts
client.instantLoans.create(...);
client.instantLoans.get({ ref });
client.instantLoans.get({ loanId });
client.instantLoans.findByAddress(address);
client.quote.calculateLtv(...); // pure helper for current LTV previews
```

`create(...)` accepts direct `collateralAmount`, `borrowAmount`, `ltvMaxBps`, and
`depositWindowSeconds` values in base units, plus external borrow/refund
destinations. It validates positive amounts, loads pools and prices, applies
SDK-side instant-loan LTV guards, creates the loan, then returns the hydrated
loan.

Current LTV guards require `ltvMaxBps` to be at least the current implied LTV
plus the SDK slippage buffer and no higher than the collateral pool max LTV. Do
not confuse the quote module's `targetLtvBps` with `create(...)`'s `ltvMaxBps`. Use
`client.quote.calculateLtv(...)` when clients need to preview the current LTV
from chosen borrow and collateral amounts before calling `create(...)`.

`create(...)` and `get(...)` do not require a wallet adapter, profile ID, or
message signing. The SDK returns deposit and repay targets for the generated
`profileId`; `get(...)` also returns `position` plus `repayment.amount` for the
full amount to send to the repayment target, including inflow fee and interest
buffer.

`findByAddress(...)` is a recovery helper and returns candidates only. Follow it
with `get({ loanId })` or `get({ ref })` before showing canonical loan state.

### market

Pool discovery, asset prices, and per-reserve data.

```ts
client.market.listPools();
client.market.findPool({ asset, chain });
client.market.getReserveData({ asset, chain });
client.market.getAssetPrices();
client.market.getPoolRate(poolId);
```

`Pool` includes `decimals`, `availableLiquidity`, caps, rates, and index data.

### quote

Quote-first planning. Use this to calculate borrow USD value, required
collateral, current LTV, validation errors, and warnings from caller-supplied market data.
For default authless loans, the quote can help choose `collateralAmount` and
`borrowAmount`; execution still goes through `client.instantLoans.create(...)`.
For advanced profile-based borrowing, fetch pools and prices first, then call
`quote` before preparing the signed borrow.

```ts
const pools = await client.market.listPools();
const prices = await client.market.getAssetPrices();
const quote = client.quote.getQuote(request, pools, prices);
const ltv = client.quote.calculateLtv(ltvRequest, pools, prices);
```

`getQuote(...)` is synchronous and pure after the app has already fetched pools
and prices. It returns `validationErrors` and `warnings`; it does not throw for
normal quote validation failures such as missing pools, missing prices, invalid
LTV, too-small borrow amounts, or disallowed same-asset borrowing. Treat a quote
with validation errors as non-executable.

`calculateLtv(...)` is also synchronous and pure after fetching pools and prices.
It accepts `borrowAmount`, `borrowPoolId`, `collateralAmount`, and
`collateralPoolId`, then returns `ltvBps`, `borrowUsd`, `collateralUsd`,
`maxAllowedLtvBps`, asset metadata, and `validationErrors`.

### accounts

Profile creation and resolution.

```ts
client.accounts.prepareCreateProfile(...);  // returns a signable action
client.accounts.createProfile(...);         // signs and submits through a wallet adapter
client.accounts.getProfileId(walletAddress);
client.accounts.listLinkedWallets(profileId);
```

### lending

Advanced profile-based borrow, withdraw, supply, repay, inflow reporting, and supply tracking. Do not use this as the default borrow UX; most apps should start with `client.instantLoans`.

```ts
client.lending.prepareBorrow(...);
client.lending.prepareWithdraw(...);
client.lending.borrow(...);
client.lending.withdraw(...);
client.lending.supply(...);
client.lending.estimateInflowFee({ asset: "USDT", chain: "ETH" });
client.lending.submitInflow({ txid, chain: "BTC", type: "DEPOSIT" });
```

### positions

Existing profile state plus aggregate position reads.

```ts
client.positions.getPosition(profileId, poolId);
client.positions.listPositions(profileId);
client.positions.getHealthFactor(profileId);
client.positions.getUserStats(profileId);
client.positions.getUserPositionSummary(profileId);  // aggregate: collateral, debt, availableBorrows, netWorth, LTV, HF
client.positions.getUserReserves(profileId);         // per-reserve view joined with pool + price data
client.positions.getMaxRepayAmount(profileId, poolId, bufferBps?); // full-repay amount with accrual buffer
```

### activities

Receipt status and active/completed/all activity lists. Requires `apiBaseUrl`.

```ts
client.activities.list({ profileId, filter: "all" });
client.activities.getStatus({ profileId, id });
```

### history

User or pool history. Requires `apiBaseUrl`.

```ts
client.history.getUserTransactionHistory(profileId, filters?);
client.history.getLiquidationHistory(profileId, filters?);
client.history.getPoolHistory(poolId, window?);
client.history.getPoolConfigHistory(poolId, cursor?);
client.history.getBorrowRateHistory(poolId, window?);
```

User history entries expose `txids?: string[]`; do not expect separate inbound
or outbound txid fields. Pool history entries are rate/utilization samples.
Pool config history entries are reserve configuration-change snapshots
(`type: "configuration_change"`) with pool config, caps, indexes, liquidity,
debt, and `sameAssetBorrowing` fields.

## Wallet Adapter

The SDK uses a `WalletAdapter` for signing and transaction execution. Implement only the methods the selected flow needs.

Default authless instant loans do not need a `WalletAdapter`. Add one only
for advanced profile creation, signed borrow/withdraw, or automated transfer
execution.

```ts
import type { WalletAdapter } from "@liquidium/client";

const walletAdapter: WalletAdapter = {
  signMessage: async ({ message }) => wallet.signMessage(message),
  sendEthTransaction: async ({ transaction }) => wallet.sendTransaction(transaction),
};
```

**Method selection:**

- `signMessage`: account creation, borrow, and withdraw flows (signs a Liquidium message)
- `sendBtcTransaction`: transfer-path supply automation for BTC targets
- `sendEthTransaction`: transfer-path automation for ETH targets and contract-interaction supply automation

## Flows

### Instant loan default flow

Use `client.instantLoans.create(...)` when the user should not create or manage
a Liquidium profile. The user supplies external destination addresses, receives
a short loan ID, then sends collateral to the generated deposit address.

Default app sequence:

1. Fetch pools and prices for pool selection and optional quote display.
2. Optionally call `client.quote.calculateLtv(...)` to show current LTV and the collateral pool's max allowed LTV.
3. Call `client.instantLoans.create(...)` with direct base-unit amounts and external destination addresses.
4. Persist or display `loan.ref` as the primary recovery key.
5. Show `loan.depositTarget` for collateral deposit and `loan.repayment.target` plus `loan.repayment.amount` for repayment.

The default instant-loan flow does not need a wallet adapter. The user signs or
broadcasts only the external wallet transfer to the generated deposit or repay
target outside the SDK.

```ts
const ltv = client.quote.calculateLtv(
  {
    collateralPoolId: btcPool.id,
    borrowPoolId: usdtPool.id,
    collateralAmount: 10_000_000n,
    borrowAmount: 2_000_000n,
  },
  pools,
  prices,
);

const loan = await client.instantLoans.create({
  collateralPoolId: btcPool.id,
  borrowPoolId: usdtPool.id,
  collateralAsset: "BTC",
  borrowAsset: "USDT",
  collateralAmount: 10_000_000n,
  borrowAmount: 2_000_000n,
  ltvMaxBps: ltv.maxAllowedLtvBps,
  depositWindowSeconds: 3_600n,
  borrowDestination: {
    type: "External",
    address: "0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222",
  },
  refundDestination: { type: "External", address: "bc1qrefunddestination" },
});

const ref = loan.ref;
const depositTarget = loan.depositTarget;
const repayTarget = loan.repayTarget;
```

Create destinations are external-only. Pass an external address string or an
external account object: `{ type: "External", address: "..." }`.

`collateralAmount` and `borrowAmount` are in each asset's base units. Use pool
`decimals` and the quote module when building UI inputs. Keep the initial loan
LTV under the SDK's instant-loan starting-LTV guard and set `ltvMaxBps` within
the collateral pool's accepted max-LTV range.

If the target is a native address, show `target.address`. If it is an ICRC
account, show `target.account`.

```ts
const depositAddress =
  depositTarget.type === "nativeAddress" ? depositTarget.address : depositTarget.account;
```

Restore a loan by `ref` whenever possible:

```ts
const loan = await client.instantLoans.get({ ref: "8Y9AQQ" });
const repayAmount = loan.repayment.amount;
const repayAddress =
  loan.repayment.target.type === "nativeAddress"
    ? loan.repayment.target.address
    : loan.repayment.target.account;
```

Use address lookup only as recovery when the user lost the loan reference:

```ts
const candidates = await client.instantLoans.findByAddress("bc1qrefunddestination");

const loan = await client.instantLoans.get({
  loanId: candidates[0].loanId,
});
```

Reference lookup is canonical. Address lookup is discovery only: it may return
multiple candidates and should be followed by `get({ loanId })` or
`get({ ref })`.

Do not use `client.lending.borrow(...)` for this flow. `lending.borrow(...)` is
the profile-based signed borrow primitive. Instant loans automate the borrow
after collateral arrives.

### Advanced: create a profile

Only use this when the app intentionally manages Liquidium profiles. Do not add
profile creation to the default authless instant-loan flow.

Convenience method when the app already has wallet signing wired:

```ts
const profileId = await client.accounts.createProfile({
  account: walletAddress,
  chain: "ETH",
  walletAdapter: {
    signMessage: async ({ message }) => wallet.signMessage(message),
  },
});
```

Prepare flow when you want explicit control over signing:

```ts
const createAction = await client.accounts.prepareCreateProfile({
  account: walletAddress,
});

const signature = await wallet.signMessage(createAction.message);

const profileId = await createAction.submit({
  signature,
  chain: "ETH",
  account: walletAddress,
});
```

`prepareCreateProfile(...)` normalizes the account and fetches the signing nonce;
it does not pre-check profile uniqueness. Handle existing profiles by catching
`PROFILE_ALREADY_EXISTS` from submission/canister validation and resolving the
profile instead of retrying the create flow.

### Read market data and positions

```ts
const pools = await client.market.listPools();
const prices = await client.market.getAssetPrices();
const positions = await client.positions.listPositions(profileId);
const healthFactor = await client.positions.getHealthFactor(profileId);
```

For an aggregate position summary (`availableBorrowsUsd`, `netWorthUsd`,
`currentLtvBps`, `healthFactor`) plus a per-reserve USD breakdown:

```ts
const summary = await client.positions.getUserPositionSummary(profileId);
const reserves = await client.positions.getUserReserves(profileId);
```

### Advanced profile-based quote-first borrow

Use this only for apps that already manage profiles and need signed borrow
execution. For the authless product flow, use the quote only for planning and
execute with `client.instantLoans.create(...)`.

```ts
const pools = await client.market.listPools();
const prices = await client.market.getAssetPrices();

const quote = client.quote.getQuote(request, pools, prices);

const outflow = await client.lending.borrow({
  profileId,
  poolId: quote.borrowPoolId,
  amount: quote.borrowAmount,
  receiverAddress,
  signerWalletAddress: walletAddress,
  signerChain: "ETH",
  signerWalletAdapter: {
    signMessage: async ({ message }) => wallet.signMessage(message),
  },
});

// `outflow.id` is the outflow reference assigned by the canister. `outflow.txid`
// may be null until the canister broadcasts the on-chain transaction. The SDK
// does not poll for the txid; consumers should display `outflow.id` immediately
// and resolve the txid separately if needed.
```

### Advanced profile-based supply flow

Use this only for profile-based integrations that intentionally manage Liquidium
profiles. Use `client.instantLoans` for the default authless borrow UX.

```ts
const supplyFlow = await client.lending.supply({
  profileId,
  poolId,
  action: "deposit",
});

if (supplyFlow.type === "transfer" && supplyFlow.target.type === "nativeAddress") {
  const depositAddress = supplyFlow.target.address;
}

await supplyFlow.submit({ txid: "<broadcast-txid>" });
```

`supply(...)` returns a receipt. When the SDK broadcast for you (wallet-adapter
path), `supplyFlow.txid` is populated. The SDK does not poll inflow status;
when you have a txid, you are responsible for polling confirmation state.

If the app wants the SDK to broadcast the transfer-path transaction, provide
`walletAdapter`, `account`, and `amount`:

```ts
const autoBroadcastFlow = await client.lending.supply({
  profileId,
  poolId,
  action: "deposit",
  amount: 100_000n,
  account: walletAddress,
  walletAdapter: {
    sendBtcTransaction: async ({ toAddress, amountSats }) =>
      wallet.sendBtcTransaction({ toAddress, amountSats }),
  },
});
```

ETH stablecoin pools default to the deposit-address transfer path. With an ETH
wallet adapter, the SDK sends an ERC-20 transfer directly to the generated
deposit address:

```ts
const supplyFlow = await client.lending.supply({
  profileId,
  poolId,
  action: "deposit",
  account: walletAddress,
  amount: 10_000_000n,
  walletAdapter: {
    sendEthTransaction: async ({ transaction }) => wallet.sendTransaction(transaction),
  },
});
```

This default flow does not require `apiBaseUrl` or an EVM RPC. Use lower-level
`getEvmSupplyContext(...)` only if you are intentionally building the
contract-interaction flow.

#### ETH Stablecoin Deposit Addresses

ETH USDT/USDC deposit-address supply uses the ETH deposit-address canister
directly. It does not require `apiBaseUrl` for target resolution.

For `mechanism: "transfer"`, the SDK resolves the deposit address by calling:

```ts
get_deposit_address(
  {
    owner: Principal.fromText(poolId),
    subaccount: [
      encodeInflowSubaccount({
        action,
        principal: Principal.fromText(profileId),
      }),
    ],
  },
  [tokenContractAddress],
);
```

Important details:

- `owner` is the selected pool principal (`poolId`)
- `subaccount` is encoded from the Liquidium `profileId` and inflow `action`
- `tokenContractAddress` is the ETH token contract address for USDT or USDC
- The SDK calls `get_deposit_address`
- The user's EVM wallet address is not used to derive the deposit address
- `apiBaseUrl` is not involved in this deposit-address lookup

If this returns `DEPOSIT_ADDRESS_ERROR: unauthorized`, do not diagnose it as a
missing API URL. Check that the selected pool principal is authorized by the ETH
deposit-address canister for the same deployment/environment.

For prod/mainnet, the SDK default ETH deposit-address canister is:
`z5jz7-nyaaa-aaaar-qb6pq-cai`.

When testing manually in the IC dashboard, use a pool principal from the same
deployment as the deposit-address canister.

Override the default route only when the app intentionally needs a specific
mechanism:

```ts
const contractInteractionFlow = await client.lending.supply({
  profileId,
  poolId,
  action: "deposit",
  mechanism: "contractInteraction",
  account: walletAddress,
  amount: 10_000_000n,
  walletAdapter: {
    sendEthTransaction: async ({ transaction }) => wallet.sendTransaction(transaction),
  },
});
```

`mechanism: "transfer"` keeps the deposit-address path explicit. `mechanism: "contractInteraction"` requires `apiBaseUrl`, `evmRpcUrl` or `evmPublicClient`, `account`, `amount`, and `sendEthTransaction`.

## Common Mistakes

1. Treating profile lending as the default borrow flow. Use `client.instantLoans.create(...)` for the authless product flow unless the user explicitly asks for profiles.
2. Adding profile creation, signed borrow, or wallet adapter requirements to instant loans. `instantLoans.create(...)` and `instantLoans.get(...)` do not need them.
3. Confusing `quote.targetLtvBps` with instant-loan `ltvMaxBps`. The quote target helps plan amounts; `ltvMaxBps` is validated by the instant-loan LTV guards.
4. `new LiquidiumClient({})` uses the default Liquidium service configuration. Override `apiBaseUrl` for custom service deployments. Lower-level contract-interaction planning also needs `evmRpcUrl` or `evmPublicClient`. `instantLoans.get(...)`, default ETH stablecoin deposit-address supply, `borrow(...)`, and `withdraw(...)` do not use the service configuration.
5. Prepare methods return signable actions, not completed actions. `prepareCreateProfile`, `prepareBorrow`, and `prepareWithdraw` still need signing and submission.
6. Build a wallet adapter with only the methods the selected flow needs. Avoid adding `signMessage`, `sendBtcTransaction`, or `sendEthTransaction` unless the flow uses them.
7. Do not `await client.quote.getQuote(...)`; it is synchronous once pools and prices are available.
8. Check `quote.validationErrors` before enabling borrow execution. Quote validation failures are returned in-band rather than thrown.
9. `client.lending.supply(...)` auto-routes by pool. BTC and ETH USDT pools currently resolve to deposit-address transfer targets by default; use `mechanism` only when intentionally overriding that route.
10. Handle existing profiles explicitly when account creation can race with existing state. Do not rely on `prepareCreateProfile(...)` to reject an existing profile before signing.
11. Work from the public modules and names exported by `@liquidium/client`. Do not invent SDK methods.
12. After `borrow(...)`, treat `outflow.id` as the user-visible reference immediately. Do not assume `outflow.txid` is set on the first response; resolve it later via activities or history if you need the chain transaction id.
13. History entries use `txids?: string[]`; do not look for legacy direction-specific txid fields.
14. ETH deposit-address `unauthorized` is usually not an `apiBaseUrl` problem. The deposit-address lookup is a direct canister call. Check the `poolId`, `ethDeposit` canister ID, token address, and deployment/environment alignment first.
15. Do not model instant loans as a `lending.supply(...)` mechanism. Use `client.instantLoans` for the authless product flow and `client.lending.supply(...)` only for advanced profile-based supply/repay integrations.
16. Do not trust address lookup as canonical loan state. Use it to find candidates, then hydrate the selected loan through `instantLoans.get(...)`.

## Preferred Style

- Keep examples minimal and app-shaped
- Use convenience methods for end-to-end app flows
- Use prepare/sign/submit flows when the user asks for signing control or custom wallet orchestration
- Reuse the app's existing wallet provider instead of adding a parallel wallet framework
- Preserve the app's state management and fetch patterns

## Defaults

- Prefer `client.instantLoans.create(...)` for the simple authless borrow UX
- Start with `new LiquidiumClient({})` for market reads and authless `instantLoans.create(...)`
- Override `apiBaseUrl` only when the app uses a custom Liquidium service deployment
- Add `evmRpcUrl` or `evmPublicClient` when the requested flow reads Ethereum chain state
- Use `chain: "ETH"` or `chain: "BTC"` exactly as required by the SDK
- Prefer a quote-first flow for advanced profile-based borrowing
- Prefer the BTC payment address when the wallet exposes both ordinals and payment addresses
